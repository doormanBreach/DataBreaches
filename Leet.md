Description:
In August 2016, the service for creating and running Pocket Minecraft edition servers known as <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/data-for-6-million-minecraft-gamers-stolen-from-leet-cc-servers-507445.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leet was reported as having suffered a data breach that impacted 6 million subscribers</a>. The incident reported by Softpedia had allegedly taken place earlier in the year, although the data set sent to HIBP was dated as recently as early September but contained only 2 million subscribers. The data included usernames, email and IP addresses and SHA512 hashes. A further 3 million accounts were obtained and added to HIBP several days after the initial data was loaded bringing the total to over 5 million.
