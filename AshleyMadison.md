Description:
In July 2015, the infidelity website Ashley Madison <a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/07/online-cheating-site-ashleymadison-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a serious data breach</a>. The attackers threatened Ashley Madison with the full disclosure of the breach unless the service was shut down. One month later, the database was dumped including more than 30M unique email addresses. This breach has been classed as &quot;sensitive&quot; and is not publicly searchable, although individuals may discover if they've been impacted by <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/NotifyMe">registering for notifications</a>. <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2015/07/heres-how-im-going-to-handle-ashley.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read about this approach in detail</a>.
