In April 2019, the social planning website for managing online invitations <a href="https://www.evite.com/security/update?usource=lc&lctid=1800182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evite identified a data breach of their systems</a>. Upon investigation, they found unauthorised access to a database archive dating back to 2013. The exposed data included a total of 101 million unique email addresses, most belonging to recipients of invitations. Members of the service also had names, phone numbers, physical addresses, dates of birth, genders and passwords stored in plain text exposed. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
