Description:
In March 2024, <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/inside-the-massive-alleged-att-data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tens of millions of records allegedly breached from AT&T were posted to a popular hacking forum</a>. Dating back to August 2021, the data was originally posted for sale before later being freely released. At the time, AT&T maintained that there had not been a breach of their systems and that the data originated from elsewhere. 12 days later, <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2024/addressing-data-set-released-on-dark-web.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&T acknowledged that data fields specific to them were in the breach and that it was not yet known whether the breach occurred at their end or that of a vendor</a>. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/30/att-reset-account-passcodes-customer-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AT&T also proceeded to reset customer account passcodes</a>, an indicator that there was sufficient belief passcodes had been compromised. The incident exposed names, email and physical addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers and US social security numbers.
