# HIAPK database leak

## Description

2014-01-01

In approximately 2014, it's alleged that the Chinese Android store known as <a href="http://hiapk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HIAPK</a> suffered a data breach that impacted 13.8 million unique subscribers. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains usernames, email addresses and salted MD5 password hashes and was provided to HIBP by white hat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.</a>
