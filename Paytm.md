In August 2020, the Indian payment provider <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/internet/paytm-mall-suffers-massive-breach-ransom-demanded-report/articleshow/77833664.cms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paytm was reported as having suffered a data breach and subsequent ransom demand</a>, after which the data was circulated publicly. Further investigation into the data concluded that <a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1552808334759043073 target="_blank" rel="noopener">the breach was fabricated and did not originate from Paytm</a>. The impacted data covered 3.4M unique email addresses along with names, phone numbers, genders, dates of birth, income levels and previous purchases.
