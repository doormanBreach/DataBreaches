Description:
In December 2017, the virtual keyboard application <a href="https://mackeepersecurity.com/post/virtual-keyboard-developer-leaked-31-million-of-client-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ai.type was found to have left a huge amount of data publicly facing in an unsecured MongoDB instance</a>. Discovered by researchers at The Kromtech Security Center, the 577GB data set included extensive personal information including over 20 million unique email addresses, social media profiles and address book contacts. The email addresses alone were provided to HIBP to enable impacted users to assess their exposure.


['Address book contacts', 'Apps installed on devices', 'Cellular network names', 'Dates of birth', 'Device information', 'Email addresses', 'Genders', 'Geographic locations', 'IMEI numbers', 'IMSI numbers', 'IP addresses', 'Names', 'Phone numbers', 'Profile photos', 'Social media profiles']
