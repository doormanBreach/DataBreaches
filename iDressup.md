Description:
In June 2016, the teen social site known as <a href="http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/09/social-hangout-site-for-teens-leaks-millions-of-plaintext-passwords/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">i-Dressup was hacked</a> and over 2 million user accounts were exposed. At the time the hack was reported, the i-Dressup operators were not contactable and the underlying SQL injection flaw remained open, allegedly exposing a total of 5.5 million accounts. The breach included email addresses and passwords stored in plain text.
