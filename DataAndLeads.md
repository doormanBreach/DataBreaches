In November 2018, <a href="https://blog.hackenproof.com/industry-news/new-data-breach-exposes-57-million-records" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Bob Diachenko identified an unprotected database believed to be hosted by a data aggregator</a>. Upon further investigation, the data was linked to marketing company <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20180925092401/https://www.datanleads.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data &amp; Leads</a>. The exposed Elasticsearch instance contained over 44M unique email addresses along with names, IP and physical addresses, phone numbers and employment information. No response was received from Data &amp; Leads when contacted by Bob and their site subsequently went offline.
