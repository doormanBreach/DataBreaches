In approximately July 2015, the Sony Playstation hacks and mods forum known as <a href="http://www.ps3hax.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS3Hax</a> was hacked and more than 447k accounts were exposed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
