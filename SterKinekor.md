Description:
In 2016, the South African cinema company <a href="http://blog.roguecode.co.za/sterkinekor-vulnerability-download-millions-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ster-Kinekor had a security flaw</a> which leaked a large amount of customer data via an enumeration vulnerability in the API of their old website. Whilst more than 6 million accounts were leaked by the flaw, the exposed data only contained 1.6 million unique email addresses. The data also included extensive personal information such as names, addresses, birthdates, genders and plain text passwords.
