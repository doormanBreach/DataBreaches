Description:
In approximately February 2016, data surfaced which was allegedly obtained from <a href="http://vtightgel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">V-Tight Gel (vaginal tightening gel)</a>. Whilst the data set was titled V-Tight, within there were <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/pN7nyjJ7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 other (predominantly wellness-related) domain names</a>, most owned by the same entity. Multiple HIBP subscribers confirmed that although they couldn't recall providing data specifically to V-Tight, their personal information including name, phone and physical address was accurate. V-Tight Gel did not reply to multiple requests for comment.
