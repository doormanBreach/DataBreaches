# LuminPDF database leak

## Description

2019-04-01

In April 2019, the PDF management service <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/data-of-24-3-million-lumin-pdf-users-shared-on-hacking-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lumin PDF suffered a data breach</a>. The breach wasn't publicly disclosed until September when 15.5M records of user data appeared for download on a popular hacking forum. The data had been left publicly exposed in a MongoDB instance after which Lumin PDF was allegedly been &quot;contacted multiple times, but ignored all the queries&quot;. The exposed data included names, email addresses, genders, spoken language and either a bcrypt password hash or Google auth token. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
