Description:
In December 2019, the now defunct gaming website SoarGames suffered a data breach that exposed 4.8M unique email addresses. The impacted data included usernames, email and IP addresses and salted MD5 password hashes. A significant number of the email addresses appeared to have been generated as opposed to organically provided by the user.
