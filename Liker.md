Description:
In March 2021, the self-proclaimed &quot;kinder, smarter social network&quot; <a href="https://liker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Liker</a> suffered a data breach, allegedly in retaliation for the Gab data breach and scraping of data from Parler. The site remained offline after the breach which exposed 465k email addresses in addition to names, dates of birth, education levels, private messages, security questions and answers in plain text, passwords stored as bcrypt hashes and other personal data attributes. Liker did not respond when contacted about the breach.
