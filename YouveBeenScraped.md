Description:
In October and November 2018, <a href="https://blog.hackenproof.com/industry-news/new-report-unknown-data-scraper-breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Bob Diachenko identified several unprotected MongoDB instances believed to be hosted by a data aggregator</a>. Containing a total of over 66M records, the owner of the data couldn't be identified but it is believed to have been scraped from LinkedIn hence the title &quot;You've Been Scraped&quot;. The exposed records included names, both work and personal email addresses, job titles and links to the individuals' LinkedIn profiles.


['Email addresses', 'Employers', 'Geographic locations', 'Job titles', 'Names', 'Social media profiles']
