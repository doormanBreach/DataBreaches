Description:
In May 2017, the restaurant guide website <a href="https://www.hackread.com/zomato-hacked-17-million-accounts-sold-on-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zomato was hacked</a> resulting in the exposure of almost 17 million accounts. The data was consequently redistributed online and contains email addresses, usernames and salted MD5 hashes of passwords (the password hash was not present on all accounts). This data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies.
