Description:
In March 2018, the Florida Virtual School (FLVS) <a href="https://www.flvs.net/notices?source=homepage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted a data breach notification to their website</a>. The school had identified a data breach which had occurred sometime between 6 May 2016 and 12 Feb 2018 and an XML file containing 368k student records was subsequently found circulating. Each record contained student name, date of birth, password, grade, email <em>and</em> parent email resulting in a total of 543k unique email addresses. Due to the prevalence of email addresses belonging to individuals who are still legally children, the data breach has been flagged as &quot;sensitive&quot;.
