Description:
In September 2016, the real estate investment site <a href="https://realestatemogul.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Real Estate Mogul</a> had a Mongo DB instance compromised and 5GB of data downloaded by an unauthorised party. The data contained real estate listings including addresses and the names, phone numbers and 308k unique email addresses of the sellers. Real Estate Mogul was advised of the incident in September 2018 and stated that they &quot;found no instance of user account credentials like usernames and passwords nor billing information within this file&quot;.
