Description:
In late March 2022, the Sri Lankan payment gateway <a href="https://www.yoshlk.me/technicity/payhere-hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PayHere suffered a data breach that exposed more than 65GB of payment records</a> including over 1.5M unique email addresses. The data also included IP and physical addresses, names, phone numbers, purchase histories and partially obfuscated credit card data (card type, first 6 and last 4 digits plus expiry date). A month later, PayHere published a blog on the incident titled <a href="https://blog.payhere.lk/ensuring-integrity-on-payhere-cybersecurity-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ensuring Integrity on PayHere Cybersecurity Incident</a>.
