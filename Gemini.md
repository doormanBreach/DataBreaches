Description:
In late 2022, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-leak-personal-info-allegedly-stolen-from-57m-gemini-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data allegedly taken from the Gemini crypto exchange was posted to a public hacking forum</a>. The data consisted of email addresses and partial phone numbers, which Gemini later attributed to <a href="https://www.gemini.com/blog/protecting-our-customers-from-phishing-campaigns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an incident at a third-party vendor</a> (the vendor was not named). The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;ZAN @ BF&quot;.
