Description:
In February 2024, the Australian Telco <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/tangerine-telecom-says-customer-data-of-232000-affected-by-cyber-incident-605337" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tangerine suffered a data breach that exposed over 200k customer records</a>. Attributed to a legacy customer database, the data included physical and email addresses, names, phone numbers and dates of birth. Whilst the Tangerine login process involves sending a one-time password after entering an email address and phone number, it previously used a traditional password which was also exposed as a bcrypt hash.
