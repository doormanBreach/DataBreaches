Description:
In May 2017, the file sharing platform <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/127-million-user-records-from-8-companies-put-up-for-sale-on-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ge.tt suffered a data breach</a>. The data was subsequently put up for sale on a dark web marketplace in February 2019 alongside a raft of other breaches. The Ge.tt breach included names, social media profile identifiers, SHA256 password hashes and almost 2.5M unique email addresses. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/breachdirectory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BreachDirectory</a>.
