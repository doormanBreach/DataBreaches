Description:
In June 2015, the French Minecraft server known as <a href="https://www.minefield.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minefield</a> was hacked and 188k member records were exposed. The IP.Board forum included email and IP addresses, birth dates and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
