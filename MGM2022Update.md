Description:
In July 2019, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/exclusive-details-of-10-6-million-of-mgm-hotel-guests-posted-on-a-hacking-forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MGM Resorts discovered a data breach of one of their cloud services</a>. The breach included 10.6M guest records with 3.1M unique email addresses stemming back to 2017. In May 2022, <a href="https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/mgm-leaked-on-telegram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a superset of the data totalling almost 25M unique email addresses across 142M rows was extensively shared on Telegram</a>. On analysis, it's highly likely the data stems from the same incident <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-is-selling-details-of-142-million-mgm-hotel-guests-on-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with 142M records having been discovered for sale on a dark web marketplace in mid-2020</a>. The exposed data included email and physical addresses, names, phone numbers and dates of birth.
