Description:
In approximately February 2015, the Sony Playstation forum known as <a href="http://psx-scene.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSX-Scene</a> was hacked and more than 340k accounts were exposed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked.
