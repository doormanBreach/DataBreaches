Description:
In August 2018, the Roblox trading site <a href="https://rbx.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rbx.Rocks</a> suffered a data breach. Almost 25k records were sent to HIBP in November and included names, email addresses and passwords stored as bcrypt hashes. In July 2019, a further 125k records emerged bringing the total size of the incident to 150k. The website has since gone offline with a message stating that &quot;Rbx.Rocks v2.0 is currently under construction&quot;.
