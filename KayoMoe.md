Description:
In September 2018, a collection of almost 42 million email address and plain text password pairs was uploaded to the anonymous file sharing service <a href="https://kayo.moe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kayo.moe</a>. The operator of the service contacted HIBP to report the data which, upon further investigation, turned out to be a large credential stuffing list.
