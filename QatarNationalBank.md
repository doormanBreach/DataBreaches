In July 2015, the Qatar National Bank <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/04/25/breaking_qatar_bank_hack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a data breach</a> which exposed 15k documents totalling 1.4GB and detailing more than 100k accounts with passwords and PINs. The incident was made public some 9 months later in April 2016 when the documents appeared publicly on a file sharing site. Analysis of the breached data suggests <a href="http://blog.trendmicro.co.uk/qatar-bank-breach-lifts-the-veil-on-targeted-attack-strategies/#more-520" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the attack began by exploiting a SQL injection flaw</a> in the bank's website.
