The Estonian police suspected the email addresses and passwords they obtained were being used to access mailboxes, cryptocurrency exchanges, cloud service accounts and other similar online assets. They've requested that individuals who find themselves in the data set <b><i>and also identify that cryptocurrency has been stolen</i></b> contact them at <a href="mailto:cybercrime@politsei.ee">cybercrime@politsei.ee</a>.
