Description:
In August 2024, over 332M rows of email addresses were posted to a popular hacking forum. The post alleged the addresses were scraped from cybersecurity firm SOCRadar, however <a href="https://socradar.io/socradars-response-to-the-usdods-claim-of-scraping-330-million-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an investigation on their behalf concluded that &quot;the actor merely utilised functionalities inherent in the platform's standard offerings, designed to gather information from publicly available sources&quot;</a>. There is no suggestion the incident compromised SOCRadar's security or posed any risk to their customers. In total, the data set contained 282M unique addresses of valid email address format.
