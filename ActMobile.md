2021-10-08

In October 2021, <a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/information-security/vpn-database-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered an exposed database he attributed to ActMobile, the operators of Dash VPN and FreeVPN</a>. The exposed data included 1.6 million unique email addresses along with IP addresses and password hashes, all of which were subsequently leaked on a popular hacking forum. Although usage of the service was verified by HIBP subscribers, <a href="https://www.databreaches.net/shoot-the-messenger-monday-edition-actmobile-threatens-researcher-whose-only-sin-was-trying-to-let-them-know-they-are-leaking-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ActMobile denied the data was sourced from them</a> and the breach has subsequently been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;.
