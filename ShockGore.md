In August 2020, the website for sharing graphic videos and images of gore and animal cruelty suffered a data breach. The breach exposed 74k unique email addresses alongside usernames, IP addresses, genders and unsalted SHA-1 password hashes. Private messages were also exposed, many containing requests for material of a depraved nature. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;white_peacock@riseup.net&quot;.
