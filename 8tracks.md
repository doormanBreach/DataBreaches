## Description

2017-06-27

In June 2017, the online playlists service known as <a href="https://blog.8tracks.com/2017/06/27/password-security-alert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8Tracks suffered a data breach</a> which impacted 18 million accounts. In their disclosure, 8Tracks advised that &quot;the vector for the attack was an employeeâ€™s GitHub account, which was not secured using two-factor authentication&quot;. Salted SHA-1 password hashes for users who <em>didn't</em> sign up with either Google or Facebook authentication were also included. The data was provided to HIBP by whitehat security researcher and data analyst Adam Davies and contained almost 8 million unique email addresses. The complete set of 18M records was later provided by JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com and updated in HIBP accordingly.
