Description:
In July 2017, the Czech Republic e-commerce site <a href="https://blog.mall.cz/o-nas/q-a-vse-co-jste-chteli-vedet-o-bezpecnosti-na-mall-cz-451.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MALL.cz suffered a data breach</a> after which 735k unique accounts including email addresses, names, phone numbers and passwords were later posted online. Whilst passwords were stored as hashes, <a href="https://pulse.michalspacek.cz/passwords/storages/site/www.mall.cz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of different  algorithms of varying strength were used over time</a>. All passwords included in the publicly distributed data were in plain text and were likely just those that had been successfully cracked (members with strong passwords don't appear to be included). According to MALL.cz, the breach only impacted accounts created before 2015.
