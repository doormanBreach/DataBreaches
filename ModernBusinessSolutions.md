Description:
In October 2016, a large Mongo DB file containing tens of millions of accounts <a href="https://twitter.com/0x2Taylor/status/784544208879292417" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was shared publicly on Twitter</a> (the file has since been removed). The database contained over 58M unique email addresses along with IP addresses, names, home addresses, genders, job titles, dates of birth and phone numbers. The data was subsequently <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/hacker-steals-58-million-user-records-from-data-storage-provider-509190.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attributed to &quot;Modern Business Solutions&quot;</a>, a company that provides data storage and database hosting solutions. They've yet to acknowledge the incident or explain how they came to be in possession of the data.
