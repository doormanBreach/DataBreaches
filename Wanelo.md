# Wanelo database leak

## Description

2018-12-13

In approximately December 2018, the digital mall <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/a-hacker-has-dumped-nearly-one-billion-user-records-over-the-past-two-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wanelo suffered a data breach</a>. The data was later placed up for sale on a dark web marketplace along with a collection of other data breaches in April 2019. A total of 23 million unique email addresses were included in the breach alongside passwords stored as either MD5 or bcrypt hashes. After the initial HIBP load, further data containing names, shipping addresses and IP addresses were also provided to HIBP, albeit without direct association to the email addresses and passwords. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
