Description:
In July 2018, the social bookmarking and sharing service <a href="https://www.sharethis.com/data-privacy-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShareThis suffered a data breach</a>. The incident exposed 41 million unique email addresses alongside names and in some cases, dates of birth and password hashes. In 2019, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace</a> (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly. The data was provided to HIBP by <a href="https://dehashed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dehashed.com</a>.
