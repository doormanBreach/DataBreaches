Description:
In September 2018, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/another-e-marketing-database-11-million-records-bob-diachenko/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered a massive collection of personal details exposed in an unprotected Mongo DB instance</a>. The data appears to have been used in marketing campaigns (possibly for spam purposes) but had little identifying data about it other than a description of &quot;Yahoo_090618_ SaverSpy&quot;. The data set provided to HIBP had almost 2.5M unique email addresses (all of which were from Yahoo!) alongside names, genders and physical addresses.
