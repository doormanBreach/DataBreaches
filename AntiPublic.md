Description:
In December 2016, a huge list of email address and password pairs appeared in a &quot;combo list&quot; referred to as &quot;Anti Public&quot;. The list contained 458 million unique email addresses, many with multiple different passwords hacked from various online systems. The list was broadly circulated and used for &quot;credential stuffing&quot;, that is attackers employ it in an attempt to identify other online systems where the account owner had reused their password. For detailed background on this incident, read <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/password-reuse-credential-stuffing-and-another-1-billion-records-in-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Password reuse, credential stuffing and another billion records in Have I Been Pwned</a>.
