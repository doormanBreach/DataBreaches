Description:
In August 2016, the pocket PC fan site forum <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210227221024/https://forum.ppcgeeks.com/site-news-announcements/153465-urgent-ppcgeeks-hacked-database-dumped.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPCGeeks suffered a data breach that exposed over 490k records</a>. The breach of the vBulletin forum exposed email and IP addresses, usernames, dates of birth and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;fall1984@protonmail.com&quot;.
