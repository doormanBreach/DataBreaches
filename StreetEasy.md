In approximately June 2016, the real estate website <a href="https://therealdeal.com/2019/02/19/a-million-streeteasy-accounts-hacked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">StreetEasy suffered a data breach</a>. In total, 988k unique email addresses were included in the breach alongside names, usernames and SHA-1 hashes of passwords, all of which appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace in February 2019. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;JimScott.Sec@protonmail.com&quot;.
