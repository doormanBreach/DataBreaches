Description:
In February 2018, the diet and exercise service <a href="https://content.myfitnesspal.com/security-information/FAQ.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyFitnessPal suffered a data breach</a>. The incident exposed 144 million unique email addresses alongside usernames, IP addresses and passwords stored as SHA-1 and bcrypt hashes (the former for earlier accounts, the latter for newer accounts). In 2019, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace</a> (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it to be attributed to &quot;BenjaminBlue@exploit.im&quot;.
