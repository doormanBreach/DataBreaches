Description:
In January 2014 just one week after <a href="http://gibsonsec.org/snapchat/fulldisclosure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gibson Security detailed vulnerabilities in the service</a>, Snapchat had 4.6 million usernames and phone number exposed. The attack involved <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2014/01/searching-snapchat-data-breach-with.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brute force enumeration of a large number of phone numbers</a> against the Snapchat API in what appears to be a response to Snapchat's assertion that such an attack was &quot;theoretical&quot;. Consequently, the breach enabled individual usernames (which are often used across other services) to be resolved to phone numbers which users usually wish to keep private.
