Description:
In September 2021, <a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/anonymous-texas-gop-epik/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Republican Party of Texas was hacked by a group claiming to be &quot;Anonymous&quot; in retaliation for the state's controversial abortion ban</a>. The September defacement was followed by a leak of data and documents which included material from the hosting provider Epik. Impacted data included over 72 thousand unique email addresses across various tables, some also including names, geographic location data, IP addresses and browser user agents.
