Description:
During 2015, the <a href="http://ipmart-forum.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">iPmart forum</a> (now known as Mobi NUKE) was hacked and over 2 million forum members' details were exposed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses, birth dates and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 368k accounts were added to &quot;Have I Been Pwned&quot; in March 2016 bringing the total to over 2.4M.
