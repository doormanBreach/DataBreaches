# MyHeritage database leak

## Description

2017-10-26

In October 2017, the genealogy website <a href="https://blog.myheritage.com/2018/06/myheritage-statement-about-a-cybersecurity-incident/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MyHeritage suffered a data breach</a>. The incident was reported 7 months later after a security researcher discovered the data and contacted MyHeritage. In total, more than 92M customer records were exposed and included email addresses and salted SHA-1 password hashes. In 2019, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the data appeared listed for sale on a dark web marketplace</a> (along with several other large breaches) and subsequently began circulating more broadly. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;BenjaminBlue@exploit.im&quot;.
