The original security incident dates back to a period between late 2018 and early 2019 and exposed data including 30k unique email addresses, names, social security numbers and notes on individuals' psychotherapy sessions. This breach has been flagged as &quot;sensitive&quot; and is only searchable by owners of the email addresses and domains exposed in the incident.
