Description:
In late 2015, the gaming website <a href="https://www.r2games.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">R2Games</a> was hacked and more than 2.1M personal records disclosed. The vBulletin forum included IP addresses and passwords stored as salted hashes using a weak implementation enabling many to be rapidly cracked. A further 11M accounts were added to "Have I Been Pwned" in March 2016 and another 9M in July 2016 bringing the total to over 22M.
