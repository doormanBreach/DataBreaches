In April 2018, the online arts database <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/02/11/620_million_hacked_accounts_dark_web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artsy suffered a data breach which consequently appeared for sale on a dark web marketplace</a>. Over 1M accounts were impacted and included IP and email addresses, names and passwords stored as salted SHA-512 hashes. The data was provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;nano@databases.pw&quot;.
