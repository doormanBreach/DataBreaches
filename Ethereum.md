Description:
In December 2016, the forum for the public blockchain-based distributed computing platform <a href="https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/12/19/security-alert-12192016-ethereum-org-forums-database-compromised/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum suffered a data breach</a>. The database contained over 16k unique email addresses along with IP addresses, private forum messages and (mostly) bcrypt hashed passwords. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-ethereum-forum-was-hacked-and-theyve-voluntarily-submitted-the-data-to-have-i-been-pwned" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ethereum elected to self-submit the data to HIBP</a>, providing the service with a list of email addresses impacted by the incident.
