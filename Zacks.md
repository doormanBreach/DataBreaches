Description:
In December 2022, the investment research company <a href="https://www.zacks.com/breach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zacks announced a data breach</a>. The following month, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/zacks-investment-research-data-breach-affects-820-000-clients/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports emerged of the incident impacting 820k customers</a>. However, in June 2023, a corpus of data with almost 9M Zacks customers appeared before being broadly circulated on a popular hacking forum. The most recent data was dated May 2020 and included names, usernames, email and physical addresses, phone numbers and passwords stored as unsalted SHA-256 hashes. On disclosure of the larger breach, Zacks advised that in addition to their original report &quot;the unauthorised third parties also gained access to encrypted [sic] passwords of zacks.com customers, but only in the encrypted [sic] format&quot;.
