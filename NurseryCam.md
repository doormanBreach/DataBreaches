Description:
In February 2021, <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/18/nurserycam_security_problems_footfallcam_ltd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of egregiously bad security flaws were identified in the NurseryCam system</a> designed for parents to remotely monitor their children whilst attending nursery. The flaws led to the exposure of over 10k parent records before the service was shut down. The email addresses alone were provided to Have I Been Pwned to ensure parents were properly notified of the incident.
