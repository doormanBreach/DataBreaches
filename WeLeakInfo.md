## Description

2021-03-08

In March 2021, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/weleakinfo-leaked-customer-payment-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Stripe account of the now-defunct WeLeakInfo service was taken over by &quot;pompompurin&quot;</a> after acquiring an expired domain name with an email address used to manage the account. Access to Stripe then exposed almost 12k unique email addresses from customers who'd made credit card payments in order to obtain breached data hosted by WeLeakInfo. The data was subsequently leaked publicly and also included names, payment histories, IP addresses, billing addresses, partial credit card data and the organisation making the purchase.
