## Description

2016-09-06

In September 2016, data was allegedly obtained from the Chinese website known as <a href="http://www.uuu9.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uuu9.com</a> and contained 7.5M accounts. Whilst there is evidence that the data is legitimate, due to the difficulty of emphatically verifying the Chinese breach it has been flagged as &quot;unverified&quot;. The data in the breach contains email addresses and user names. <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/handling-chinese-data-breaches-in-have-i-been-pwned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read more about Chinese data breaches in Have I Been Pwned.</a>
