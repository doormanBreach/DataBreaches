The breach also included data from the TruckerSucker &quot;dating app for REAL TRUCKERS and REAL MEN&quot; with the combined corpus of data also exposing usernames, IP addresses, dates of birth, sexual orientations, geo locations, private messages between members and passwords stored as salted MD5 hashes. The data was listed on a public hacking site and provided to HIBP by a source who requested it be attributed to &quot;discord.gg/gN9C9em&quot;.
